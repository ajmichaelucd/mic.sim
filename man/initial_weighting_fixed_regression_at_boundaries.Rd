\title{Intial Weighting Scheme: Fixed Regression at Boundaries}
\usage{
initial_weighting_fixed_regression_at_boundaries(
  visible_data,
  ncomp,
  sd_parameter = 0.2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{visible_data}{the data frame passed into the EM algorithm, at minimum consists of: an id column, a time column, left_bound, right_bound, low_con, and high_con}

\item{ncomp}{number of components in the model being fitted, this weighting scheme only is valid for 2 component models}
}
\description{
Fits regression lines with slope = 0 at high_con and low_con with sigma values of 0.2 times the difference between high_con and low_con, and calculates initial weights from this
}
