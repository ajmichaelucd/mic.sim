\arguments{
\item{output}{List, output of a fit_EM()}

\item{title}{String, title of plot}

\item{add_log_reg}{Logical, add a curve to the pi (component weight) plot showing proportion resistant and susceptible}

\item{ecoff}{Numeric or String, represents an ECOFF on the MIC Scale to define the upper limit of the WT component, A number is interpreted as WT being <= ECOFF.}

\item{s_breakpoint}{String, represents S breakpoint (e.g. <= 2) on MIC scale (not log2 scale)}

\item{r_breakpoint}{String, represents R breakpoint (e.g. >= 32) on MIC scale (not log2 scale)}

\item{visual_split}{Numeric or String, represents a visual split point on the MIC scale to define the upper limit of the WT component. A number is interpreted as WT being <= visual_split}

\item{use_prior_step}{Logical, if one mu model did not converge, can try plotting mu models from previous step by setting this to TRUE}

\item{range_zoom}{Logical, zoom y axis to range of tested concentrations}

\item{plot_range}{Vector of length 2, minimum and maximum values of y axis of plot}

\item{start_date}{Integer, value at which x axis should start (year).}

\item{x_axis_t_breaks}{Numerical vector, vector of values on the scale of t, the time variable in years from the start of the study. Helpful to use seq(0,t_max, by = spacing) where t_max is the length of study period and spacing is how many years to separate major ticks by}

\item{skip}{Vector, vector of either "ecoff", "bkpts", or c("ecoff", "bkpts"), to describe any splits for which logistic regression should not be plotted if another logistic regression is being plotted. If only one divider is used, just turn off add_log_reg}
}
\description{
Takes output of a fit_EM() run and plots it.
Logistic regression fitting is in progress (currently does not accept covariates and non-linear term must be "t")
