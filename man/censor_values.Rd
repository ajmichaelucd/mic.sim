\usage{
censor_values(
  observed_value,
  MIC_breakpoint,
  low_con = 2^-4,
  high_con = 2^4,
  tested_concentrations = log2(low_con):log2(high_con),
  output_scale = "concentration"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MIC_breakpoint}{is the highest MIC that is still S (the MIC where susceptible is defined as â‰¥ MIC), this value is on the MIC scale (we take log2 of MIC_breakpoint before applying it to the continuous values that are simulated on the log2 scale)}

\item{tested_concentrations}{}
}
\value{

}
\description{
adds new columns with left and right censoring indicators, setting up the creation of a Surv object with interval2 format
}
