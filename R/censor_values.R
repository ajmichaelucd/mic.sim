#' censor_values
#'
#' adds new columns with left and right censoring indicators, setting up the creation of a Surv object with interval2 format
#'
#' @param df must contain a column named "observed value" which contains the uncensored simulated values
#' @param MIC_breakpoint is the highest MIC that is still S (the MIC where susceptible is defined as â‰¥ MIC), this value is on the MIC scale (we take log2 of MIC_breakpoint before applying it to the continuous values that are simulated on the log2 scale)
